# AWS Calculator

## Statement

This [document](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/AWS-Calculator/blob/main/Statement.pdf) contains the functionality for each file and function.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

1. Create functions.
2. Call functions with parameters.
3. Call functions from other functions (function composition).
4. Create and use a module.
5. Test the functions of a module.
6. Build console-based user interfaces.

## How does it work?

The [calculadora_aws.py](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/AWS-Calculator/blob/main/calculadora_aws.py) file contains a function for each requirement. The files that contain the word "consola" individually execute each functionality of the file [calculadora_aws.py](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/AWS-Calculator/blob/main/calculadora_aws.py) interacting with the user with messages, inputs and responses through the console.
